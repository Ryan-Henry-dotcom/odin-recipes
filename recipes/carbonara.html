        <h3>Spaghetti alla Carbonara Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Cured pork cheek</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheese</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The essentials:</strong> Salt your water; Boil and strain your pasta, making sure <strong>NOT</strong> to dispose your pasta water (I'm assuming you understand that you need to let the water boil before adding the <strong>UNSNAPPED</strong> pasta strands); Dice your cured pork.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Cook the cured pork in olive oil until browned and crispy, then drain (and save) the oil.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Whisk in the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl 'til it's smooth</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy. Do that under low heat, otherwise the eggs'll become scrambled.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Stir in the pork, add a tiny amount of that pork oil (and if the pasta isn't as creamy as you'd like it to be, you can stir in small amounts of the pasta water from earlier 'til you're satisfied), then plate it with the remaining cheese and black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Personal Note: If you're planning on eating this dish, you shouldn't be worrying about a diet.</p>
